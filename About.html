    <p class = "important">History:</p>
    <p class = "history">On the 27th of September 1978, Portmore gave birth to Bridgeport Secondary School with a total of 228 students (107 boys and 121 girls) and 28 members of staff. The school was built by West Indies Home Contractors Limited to accomodate five hundred (500) students. Since then the name was changed from Bridgeport Secondary to Bridgeport Comprehensive High in 1991, when the school got its first batch of Common Entrance students. The school has since been reclassified to Bridgeport High School in September 2000, under the Ministry of Education reclassfication of secondary education. Presently the school operates on shift and extended systems with an average student population of 1700.</p>
