    <h1>School Song:</h1>

    <p class = "important"></p>
    <div class = "song">
      <p>Arise glad hearts, swell fort a song of praise</p>
      <p> With one accord, give thanks for this our school </p>
      <p>Our hopes are kindled, we now see brigher days</p>
      <p>In which to thrive and florish; our fears as our footstool</p>
      <p>Challenges will come but we will be ready</p>
      <p>Our vision poised and mind calm and steady</p>
      <p>We'll be prepared to meet every test</p>
      <p>We'll be prepared to give of our best</p>
      <p>We'll be prepared to meet every quest</p>
      <p>Through educacion total, para personajes totales</p>
    
    <br> 
    
      <p>Our country calls, we will respond with joy</p>
      <p>To take our place, our services to give</p>
      <p>Our hands then trained, our skill we will employ</p>
      <p>To build and guard Jamaica as long as we shall live</p>
      <p>For within these walls, our minds trained to conquer</p>
      <p>And on these fields, our brawn growing stronger</p>
      <p>We are being prepared to meet every test</p>
      <p>We are being  prepared to give of our best</p>
      <p>We are being prepared to meet every quest</p>
      <p>Through educacion total, para personajes totales</p>
    
    <br>
    
      <p>Over the seas, in the distance lands we hear</p>
      <p>Of places where the work of justice sway</p>
      <p>Millions die, and million live in fear</p>
      <p>Schoolmates we will teach them, to live a better way</p>
      <p>Our way have chanded, we're touched by the master</p>
      <p>Our wills are stronger, our love much vaster</p>
      <p>We have been prepared to meet every test</p>
      <p>We have been prepared to give of our best</p>
      <p>We have been prepared to meet every quest</p>
      <p>Through educacion total, para personajes totales</p>
    
    <br>
    
      <p>So now we say, may this our school stand firm</p>
      <p>May truth and love her guide and watchword be</p>
      <p>Discord and ill be trodden like a worm</p>
      <p>While peace and joy and beauty flow from her like a sea</p>
      <p>Until all around on lips and far near</p>
      <p>One grand chorus rings out loudly and clear</p>
      <p>We are truly geared to meet every test</p>
      <p>We are truly geared to give of our best</p>
      <p>We are truly geared to meet every quest</p>
      <p>With educacion total, para personajes totales</p>
